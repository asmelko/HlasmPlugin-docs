\chapter{Project execution}

\section{Team}
This team consists of five members:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Michal Bali,
	\item Marcel Hruška,
	\item Peter Polák,
	\item Adam Šmelko,
	\item Lucia Tódová.
\end{itemize}

Each team member is responsible for delivering work packages assigned to him or her. 

\section{Collaboration}
As the collaboration within the team is essential for successful completion of the project, we use a variety of means and methods to achieve this. 

Our team works with agile software development. To aid this, we use a visual process management system called Kanban. Our team meets every week with our supervisor at stand-ups and discusses the current status of particular tasks with their owners, reviews progress and plans work for the next week.

For communication between team members, we use an online tool --- Slack.

\section{Project timeline}
The project is split into several milestones and work packages. At the time of writing this document, the milestone \hyperref[milestone_preview]{Preview} has been reached. Therefore, there is currently a working prototype, and some of the presented work packages are already specified. 

The implementation of the project is planned to be done within nine months. We do not expect any technical issues as this project is in quite developed stage and is supported by company. Therefore, we are very confident that the project will be completed as it is planned. 

Work packages have been assigned to individual team members during stand-ups. The work packages, their deadlines and assignments are in the following table and Gantt diagram \ref{fig:gantt-pokus}.

\bms
	\itemm Research and analysis \deadline{2}{2}
	
		\small The output of this milestone should be deeper knowledge and understanding of HLASM language, selection of parser library and target IDE.
		HLASM is complicated language, hence the choice of right parser library is vital for further development. Also important is to choose IDE in witch would be the language support integrated.
	
		\bwp
			\itemwp HLASM language analysis \people{Adam, Marcel}
					\tiny study and analysis of HLASM documentation, available code and discussion with HLASM users
					
			\itemwp Parser libraries research \people{Peter}
					\tiny research and comparison of contemporary lexical and parser libraries (Bison, ANTLR, ...) 
					
			\itemwp IDEs research \people{Michal, Lucia}
					\tiny research of available IDEs to which would be the HLASM language support integrated
