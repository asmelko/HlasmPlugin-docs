\chapter{Background and goals}


The IBM High Level Assembler Language is still actively used commercially, even though it is a relatively old language. 

Today's HLASM developers are forced to code in the archaic terminals directly on the mainframe. Therefore, they spend too much time navigating the code. For developers, it would be extremely useful to have an IDE plugin that could analyze the HLASM program, check its validity and make the code clearer by highlighting it. 

The aim of this project is to elevate programming in HLASM language to be compared with coding in modern programming languages.

\section{Related Work}

Naturally, there exists a HLASM compiler, specifically the one from IBM. Our team will be granted access to this compiler. During the implementation of language features we will use this compiler to recognize all the details of assembling behavior. 

Visual Studio Code Marketplace already has a plugin for HLASM language. However it provides only syntax highlighting. The team will analyze this plugin while developing the project.
